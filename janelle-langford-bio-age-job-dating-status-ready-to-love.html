Read all about her age, job, and family members as this article proceeds.</p><p>Learn all we know about her in this video.</p><h3><strong>Janelle Langford On Ready To Love</strong></h3><p>Janelle Langford is one of the singles appearing on Ready To Love.</p><p>In the show, Janelle bonded with Herbert Smith in the first episode of the show. Janelle described him as “looking all good, very nice, great energy” and she was here for all of it. The couple were flirting and touching one another so there definitely was a spark there between the two.</p><p>Herbert tells Janelle that he wasn’t married before and he wants kids (how many lord says). Janelle thought their interaction “wasn’t forced” and “it felt good.”</p><p>She recently took to her IG to share her experience of being on the show via a lengthy post.</p><p>“When I started the application process (September) of the Ready to Love journey, I was just coming out a tumultuous relationship. One that I walked away from still believing in love but understanding what love requires. And more importantly, what love isn’t,” she started the post. “I was a huge fan of the show so when the opportunity presented itself and my moving to Dallas finally showed purpose, I jumped on it without hesitation.”</p><p>She added that it wasn’t an enjoyable experience for her. She added, “I have a new found respect for reality TV stars. As an audience, you have absolutely no clue what you are really watching, yet form opinions without context…. I hate that for you.”</p><p>In July 2023 a brand-new season of Ready to Love premiered. A fresh set of singles will be featured in the following season, who will try to find love on OWN TV while traveling to Dallas. Only on OWN, the new season of Ready to Love will debut on Friday, July 7, 2023, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>The press release read, “These are grown men and women in their 30’s and 40’s who are seeking the special relationship-of-a-lifetime that has eluded them thus far, and the baggage they each bring to the party is real.” 18 singles participated in this season of the dating reality show as they bonded with one another in an effort to find love. This dating reality show covers singles in their 30s and 40s, which is unusual for most of them.</p><p>The Ready to Love cast will get to know one another at a Mansion Mixer in Dallas before the program airs. Even before the evening is over, two cast members will say their farewell.</p><p>Following their interactions with the men, the female competitors and the men will both determine which male single they don’t want to get to know any further. Each week, one single’s mission to find love ends, therefore the remaining candidates must continue to strive to win each other over. According to the press release, the turmoil, love triangles, and broken hearts will either endanger or strengthen the burgeoning romances. Only “the strongest connections” will endure, though.</p><h3><strong>What Is Janelle Langford Dating Status?</strong></h3><p>As of this article, Janelle Langford appears single.
