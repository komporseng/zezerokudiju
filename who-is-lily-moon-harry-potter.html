She was in the same year as Harry Potter and was Sorted into either Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin.</strong></p><p>What Hogwarts house is Lily moon in? Lily Moon was a <b>Slytherin</b> student who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991, the same year as Harry Potter.<br>…</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Lily Moon</th></tr><tr><th>Biographical information</th></tr><tr><td>House</td><td><b>Slytherin</b></td></tr><tr><td>Loyalty</td><td>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Dumbledore’s Army (during the Battle of Hogwarts</td></tr><tr><td>.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>What is a moon in Harry Potter? You may be looking for someone with the surname Moon. … The moon’s phases were very useful and important in the wizarding world. The moon shone so brightly in the night sky as <b>it reflected light directly</b> from the sun.</p><p>Beside above What blood is Lily Potter? Muggle borns are wizards/witches born in a non wizard family. James Potter is a pure blood, but Lily is a muggle born, so Harry is a <b>half Blood</b>. Same strategy as Ron and Hermione. Ron is a pure blood, but Hermione is a muggle born, so their children would be half blood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_does_Lily_Luna_marry></span>Who does Lily Luna marry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Hogwarts, Lily married <b>Lysander Scamander</b> and together, the couple had three children: Lyra, Luna, and Lucas Scamander.</p><p>Is Luna Lovegood related to Draco Malfoy? They may be related, but that would have to be very distantly. Luna’s father is Xenophilius Lovegood, and her mother died in front of her when she was nine. Draco’s father is Lucius Malfoy, and his mother is Narcissa Malfoy, née Black. So even if they’re related, they <b>most definitely are not siblings</b>.</p><p>Simply so, Is Harry’s son a Slytherin? Albus Severus is the main character in “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.” He’s the ugly duckling of the family, is <b>sorted into Slytherin</b>, befriends Scorpius Malfoy, and isn’t good at magic. He’s nicknamed “Albus Potter, the Slytherin Squib.”</p><p>Who married George Weasley? Sometime after the end of the Second Wizarding war, George married <b>Angelina Johnson</b>, with whom he had a son named Fred, in honour of his late twin, and a daughter named Roxanne. He and his brother Ron also turned Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes into a huge money spinner.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Lily_Luna_Potter_godparents></span>Who is Lily Luna Potter godparents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are the godparents for James Sirius. Neville Longbottom is the godfather to Albus Severus (and presumably his wife Hannah Abbott is the godmother). <b>Lily Luna’s godparents are not known</b>, but based on her middle name, Luna Lovegood is the most likely candidate for godmother.</p><p>Is Rolf Scamander a pure-blood? No, he Rolf <b>is an Half Blood</b>, since Tina, his grandmother was an Halfblood. … The rules are, if he isn’t a pure-blood (NO non-magical blood) or a muggle-born (no magical blood), he’s a half-blood.</p><p>What’s Luna Lovegood’s middle name?</p><p>Her Name’s <b>Luna Elizabeth Lovegood</b> as it was her mother’s name.</p><p>Who plays Harry Potter’s son? HARRY Potter star <b>Arthur Bowen</b> has fans heads spinning as he looks completely unidentifiable after 10 years. Arthur, 23, played Harry Potter’s second child Albus Severus Potter in the seventh movie of the iconic franchise.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_if_James_had_his_wand></span>What if James had his wand?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If James had his wand with him, <b>he probably could have bought Lilly a few more seconds</b>, but it wouldn’t have made a difference. Probabaly the same amount of time. Voldemort went straight in with the killing curse which cannot be blocked by any spell.</p><p>Did Percy become a Death Eater?</p><p><b>Percy Weasley never joined the Deatheaters</b>, yes, he was still working in the Ministary of magic when Voldemort took control of it, but so was everyone else who worked there.</p><p>Who married Neville Longbottom? We now know that Neville ended up marrying <b>Hannah Abbott</b> and became Herbology Professor at Hogwarts. Plus he and his wife lived above the Leaky Cauldron. Neville finally got his happy ending – and here’s why he deserved it more than anybody else.</p><p>Who did Angelina Johnson marry? After the Second Wizarding War, Angelina married <b>George Weasley</b> and they had two children; a son, named Fred Weasley II, in honour of George’s brother, and a daughter, Roxanne.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_does_Draco_not_marry_pansy></span>Why does Draco not marry pansy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>J. K. Rowling has said that Pansy did not end up marrying <b>Draco because Rowling always hated her</b>: “I loathe Pansy Parkinson.</p><p>Who is James Sirius Potter’s wife? James Sirius Potter was born on July 16, 2005. James is the eldest child to Harry and Ginny Potter. He has two younger siblings, Albus Severus and Lily Luna. He is the husband to <b>Mavis Longbottom</b>, and the father to her children, Maverick and Jasper Potter.</p><p>Why is Lily Luna Potter named after Luna?</p><p>Lily Luna Potter (b. c. 2008) was an English half-blood witch, the youngest child and only daughter of Harry and Ginevra Potter (née Weasley). … She was named <b>in honour of her late paternal grandmother, Lily Potter</b>, and her middle name came from her parents’ good friend Luna Lovegood.</p><p>Who got married first Harry or Ron? <b>Harry Ginny got married first</b>. I like to believe Ron Hermione took their time and enjoyed their unmarried lives more and focused on their careers before settling down. Technically, since Rowling zoomed ahead 19 years, none of the characters actually got married.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_did_Hagrid_marry></span>Who did Hagrid marry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hagrid was the surname of a wizarding family. Mr Hagrid married <b>the Giantess Fridwulfa</b>, and she bore him a half-giant son named Rubeus Hagrid.</p><p>Is Leta Lestrange Bellatrix Lestrange’s mother? Leta’s tragic story is pretty much on par with her family’s dark reputation. … Funnily enough, the most famous Lestrange is one only by marriage, and despite really adorable Instagram photos that make us wish it so, <b>there is no blood relation between Leta and Bellatrix whatsoever</b>.</p><p>Are the Scamander’s Purebloods?</p><p>We know that during events in Paris, Leta Lestrange attended the pure-bloods ball with Theseus Scamander, Newt’s older brother, where they met Yaxley. This ball was only for pure-blood wizards.</p><p>Who is the most famous Hufflepuff? <b>Harry Potter: Notable Hufflepuffs, Ranked By Power</b></p><li>1 Helga Hufflepuff. It should come as no surprise, but the most powerful and legendary Hufflepuff of all time is the titular lass herself, Helga Hufflepuff.</li><li>2 Fat Friar. …</li><li>3 Newt Scamander. …</li><li>4 Nymphadora Tonks. …</li><li>5 Theseus Scamander. …</li><li>6 Pomona Sprout. …</li><li>7 Hannah Abbott. …</li><li>8 Teddy Lupin. …</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Harry_name_his_daughter_after_Luna></span>Why did Harry name his daughter after Luna?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Apart form all the reasons mentioned above, Luna was <b>more of a close friend to Ginny</b>. Surely Ginny, the mother of Lily Luna Potter and wife of Harry Potter, would have liked to name her daughter after her close friend who stayed by her side and fought loyally during their 6th year at Hogwarts. He named her after LUNA.</p><p>Is Luna Lovegood a pureblood? Luna Lovegood is <b>a Pureblood witch</b>, who was sorted into Gryffindor House during Harry Potter’s second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry.</p><p>Don’t forget to share this post 🖤</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKm7jKKqZqSZocZuuc6opWagkae%2FunnPqKutnaJk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chelsea-houska.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chelsea Houska</a>
