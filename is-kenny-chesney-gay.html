Kenny tied the nuptial knot with actress <a href=#>Renee Zellweger</a> in 2005, and this marriage is pretty much enough to state this singer’s sexuality. The couple was in love at that time, and their romance was hidden from none.</p><p>But their relationship vanished almost as quickly as it had started. They filed for divorce just four months after their marriage. The annulment went into effect in December. And that’s where the rumors of him being gay come into effect. The couple stated “fraud” as the reason for their decision, and everyone linked the word “fraud” with Kenny’s sexuality.</p><p>His exact statement was – We thought the least harmful was a fraud because it’s kind of board – doesn’t specify. And Boy, we were wrong.</p><p>That single statement created tons of doubts and questions in everyone’s minds. Many thought the word Fraud was referring to the country star, Kenny himself, implying that he is gay. Although Renne, Kenny’s ex-wife, stated that they only meant fraud in the legal sense, it was too late to stop the rumors.</p><p>As a result, the rumors about his sexuality spread like wildfire and made people think about him being gay.

But now the rumor is turning into reality, and it’s time for some clarifications.</p><p>Kenny once said in an interview that when he and Renee filed an annulment, they found the best reason for settling this legal thing by selecting the “fraud” option. He also opened up with the fact that they thought Fraud was the least harmful, but they were absolutely wrong. This one word had almost destroyed his reputation.</p><p>Fans all over the world came up with multiple theories explaining Renne cited Fraud as the reason for the annulment. And the most popular theory was that Kenny was secretly gay. His ex-wife, Renee attempted to shut down these rumors but fans being fans hadn’t stopped. Kenny also said that he would have clarified his sexual orientation earlier in one of his interviews with 60 Minutes. In 2009, he told Playboy magazine that he had multiple girls who could testify that he was not gay.</p><p>He also regretted his decision of annulment, and it was the major thing that gave birth to all these rumors.
