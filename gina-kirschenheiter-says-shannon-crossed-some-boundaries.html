All I know is that it’s some pill that people are taking or something like that.

This sounds terrible. Let’s eat some more things!’ before she was noted to make a show of tucking into her pastry.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also spoke about the harsh criticism she has faced over her weight, and acknowledges that she previously struggled with an eating disorder.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kate added that as a result of that she now doesn’t let people talk about weight, and calls them out if they do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: ‘I never told anyone about it. Because guess what — people in the world around you go: “Hey, you look great! You lost weight!”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘So even the compliment about looking good is connected to weight. And that is one thing I will not let people talk about.
