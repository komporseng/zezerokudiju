The pair started dating in 2017 and has been together for five years now. They have been going stronger since the start of their relationship and recently celebrated their five-year anniversary in September 2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The pair officially announced their relationship through a video titled <a href=# rel=noopener>Something I’ve NEVER Talked About... (Meet My Girlfriend)</a> on mid-October 2018 after dating for a year. What's more, Fishman was even Emily's high school crush, but he did not have feelings for her back then. And after two years, Adi finally realized his affection for her during junior year and eventually started to take a step forward toward their relationship and the rest is history.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Meanwhile, there have been rumors of their split after they pulled a breakup prank on their fans. In the <a href=# rel=noopener>breakup video</a>, Adi acted so real and even cried which made people believe that they have actually parted ways. However, they posted a video after three days disclosing it was all a prank, and also posted the behind-the-scenes of their breakup video. It seems like many people haven't watched this video and still think the couple is not together anymore.</p><p>The love birds even have their separate family channel or say couple channel which was called the Diem Family (now renamed as <a href=# rel=noopener>Adi&Em</a>). The channel features vlogs, challenges, and pranks that they pull on each other and also their friends. And their relationship took a new turn as now they have even moved in together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span id=ez-clearholder-banner-1></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 banner-1 banner-1360 adtester-container adtester-container-360" data-ez-name=celebsfortune_com-banner-1><span id=div-gpt-ad-celebsfortune_com-banner-1-0 ezaw=336 ezah=280 class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span data-nosnippet class=reportline data-ez-ph-owner-id=30><span class=ezoicwhat><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png alt=Ezoic title=ezoic name="?pageview_id=3687e8a9-7902-4710-47a0-29aeb00083fa&ad_position_id=30&impression_group_id=celebsfortune_com-banner-1/2024-01-08/9069537515121973&ad_size=336x280&domain_id=333243&url=https://celebsfortune.com/emily-alexander-net-worth-adi-fishman/" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></span><h2>Fans Accuse Emily Alexander of Being a Gold Digger</h2><p>Being an internet couple is really hard as people will pass judgment on relationships and even backlash you now and then.
