Her Relationship Status, Father</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Meet Kathrine Narducci, who steals the show as Fezco’s gun-toting grandma, Marie, on the second season of Euphoria.</p><p>So yeah! Ever since Euphoria Season 2 premiered on 9 January 2022, Marie, the “motherf—ing G”, is all we have been wondering about.</p><p>And now is a time we tell you about what her life’s like when she is not playing Marie but living as Kathrine Narducci in an off-the-screen world.</p><h3><strong>Kathrine Narducci Husband</strong></h3><p>Katherine Narducci had been married to her husband Richard Arthur Ligotino until he, unfortunately, passed away in 2002. Katherine has not divulged any further intimate details about her late husband.</p><p>All we know is Katherine now is the mother of two children: daughter Sally Ann Prisco and son Nicholas Ligotino. And they are her kids with her late husband (of course).</p><p>So now from the look of Katherine’s social media, her “cubs” are all grown-up adults.</p><p>Sally, in her words, is a “newborn” photographer serving in New York City and the Tri-State area as the owner/operator of Sally Prisco Photography. And then there’s Nicholas who is the owner of Nicky liggy’s bar in Bronx, New York.</p><h3><strong>Kathrine Narducci Relationship Status</strong></h3><p>Since the devastating loss of her husband, Katherine Narducci has not opened about her dating life. She has always been rumored to be single.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kathrine-narducci-husband-relationship-status-father-2022-300x260.jpg><p>And until 2017, she was still recalling the days with her deceased husband.</p><h3><strong>What Roles Does Kathrine Narducci Play On Euphoria?</strong></h3><p>So lately everyone including Katherine Narducci’s daughter has been exceptionally impressed with Katherine’s cool role as she played Fez’s grandmother Kitty in flashbacks on the second season of Euphoria. It was Katherine’s character who had taken in Fez as a child and had&nbsp;introduced him to the drug trade.</p><p>In Euphoria’s present day, Kitty is bedridden, so it is unlikely we will see a return of Katherine’s “trash-talking portrayal”. But she has anyway proven her craft as a memorable performance in her brief appearance, as a character we had only occasionally seen.</p><p>The Season 2, Episode 1 opening scene is all her. And everyone seeing her on it through this role she did as by far the most notable performance of her career.</p><p>No doubt, Twitter blew up afterward with a lot of fans talking about her character.</p><p>Even Zendaya, who plays Rue Bennett, posted a picture of Katherine in character on that night the show aired.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kathrine Narducci Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Katherine Narducci reportedly had less than $2 million worth of net worth as of January 2022; presumably from more than 30 years of her career as an actor.</p><p>Of many roles she did before Euphoria she was most noted for her performance in The Irishman (2019), Capone (2020), and Godfather of Harlem (2019).</p><p>Viewers also loved her as Charmaine Bucco, Artie Bucco’s wife, on the HBO TV series The Sopranos and when she starred in Chicago Overcoat and Two Family House and during guest TV appearances on shows such as Law & Order, Workaholics, NYPD Blue, Third Watch and Power.</p><h3><strong>Kathrine Narducci Father</strong></h3><p>Katherine Narducci’s father is late Nicky Narducci.</p><p>She grew up with a father with mob connections. And though she likely did not know anything about it at the time, her father had a long rap sheet.</p><p>In a 1973 book on corrupt cops, Nicky Narducci was described as “a tough hood … with a lot of arrests on his record.”</p><p>Then, when Katherine was 10, her father was on the receiving end of a hail of bullets and was killed in a mob-style hit circa 1976 outside the Upper East Side bar he ran.</p><p>Talking about it now, Katherine describes she felt like having 20 other fathers and that all she knew was she felt very safe. “Not knowing who they were or what they did, I just knew they kept everything safe.”</p><p>It was long before she realized what her polished father figures did when she was not looking.</p><p>More people in Katherine’s family, that we know of, is her sister Rhonda Narducci.</p><p>And Katherine’s baby sister is not just close to her sister but also her kids Sally and Nicholas.</p><p>“I m so proud of you Aunt Rhonda. You deserve this good life you’re working so hard to make for yourself! Keep going, your future is filled with so much love and happiness. Im so happy that I get to watch it unfold”, this is an excerpt from what Katherine’s daughter Sally took to her Facebook in love for her aunt.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Kathrine Narducci?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>It is on the 27th of November that Katherine Narducci celebrates her birthday.
