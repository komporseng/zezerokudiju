He spent his whole 13-year NBA career with Boston, where he won three championships. McHale was admitted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999, but what has he done since then, and how much money does he have now?</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Kevin McHale was born in Hibbing, Minnesota, to a part-Irish American father, Paul Austin McHale, and a Croatian-American mother, Josephine Patricia Starcevich. McHale was selected Minnesota’s Mr. Basketball in 1976 during his senior year at Hibbing High School, where he led his team to a runner-up finish in the AA Minnesota State Championship game.</p><p>McHale was inducted into the Minnesota State High School League Hall of Fame in 1992.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>McHale was a member of one of the league’s top frontlines, along with small forward Larry Bird and centre Robert Parish. The “Big Three” of Hall of Famers would lead the Celtics to five NBA Finals trips and three NBA Championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986.</p><p>McHale, who has a wide range of offensive skills near to the basket, appeared in seven National Basketball Association All-Star Games between 1984 and 1991. In 1987 and 1988, he topped the NBA in field goal percentage, shooting 60.4 percent each season. McHale was also a standout defensive player, being named to the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team six times. He blocked nine shots in a game twice, the most by a Boston Celtics player (blocked shots did not become an official NBA statistic until the 1974 season).</p><p>McHale played mostly off the bench for the Celtics for the first five years of his career, receiving the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 1984 and 1985.</p><p>McHale had his best season as a forward in 1986-87, when he was chosen to the All-NBA First Team.</p><h2>After Retirement What’s He Doing</h2><p>McHale joined the Timberwolves as a TV analyst and special assistant after retiring from the NBA. New Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor promoted him to AGM in 1994. He televised Timberwolves games and worked as an executive until 1995, when he succeeded Jack McCloskey as VP of Basketball Operations.</p><p>McHale hired former colleague Flip Saunders as Timberwolves coach.</p><p>McHale drafted high school phenom Kevin Garnett fifth overall in 1995. In Garnett’s 12 seasons with the Timberwolves, they never moved past the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.</p><p>During McHale’s tenure, the Timberwolves were penalised by the NBA for striking a secret arrangement with Joe Smith to skirt salary cap restrictions. Smith signed three one-year contracts with the Timberwolves for less than market value before the 1998-1999 season. In exchange, the Timberwolves promised Smith a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract before 2001-2002.</p><p>After hearing about the secret arrangement, NBA commissioner David Stern cancelled Smith’s last one-year contract, making him a free agent. Stern took three of the Timberwolves’ next five first-round picks and fined them $3.5 million. Smith spent one season in Detroit before returning to Minnesota as a free agent.</p><p>The Timberwolves dismissed Saunders on February 12, 2005, and McHale took over as head coach. He went 19-12 as coach but didn’t want to continue. 2005 off-season hire: Dwane Casey.&nbsp;Midway through the 2006-2007 season, McHale dismissed Casey. Randy Wittman will replace Casey.&nbsp;Despite losing the playoffs, McHale and Wittman will return for 2007-2008.</p><p>McHale wanted to trade Kevin Garnett to the Celtics for a draught selection and players before the 2007 NBA Draft. Garnett’s representative told the Timberwolves and Celtics that his client didn’t want to play for Boston, killing the trade.</p><p>Minnesota and Boston tried to trade Garnett in late July 2007. On July 31, Garnett was dealt to the Celtics for five players and two first-round choices. Garnett finished third in MVP voting and was voted NBA Defensive Player of the Year as Boston beat the Lakers.</p><h2>Death Of ‘Alexandra “Sasha” McHale’ Kevin’s Daughter</h2><p>According to Jonathan Feigen of The Houston Chronicle, the Houston Rockets delivered the tragic revelation that their coach’s daughter died on Saturday afternoon after a long struggle with lupus.</p><p>Alexandra “Sasha” McHale was just 23 years old when she died.</p><p>Kevin McHale has been absent from the squad since November 10 to spend time with his family during the last weeks of this terrible saga. Assistant coach Kelvin Sampson has taken over for his colleague and will do so until McHale is able to return.</p><p>Leslie Alexander, team owner, issued the following statement through the club (per Feigen):</p><p><strong><span style=font-size:18pt>“I extend my deepest condolences to Kevin and Lynn for the loss of their beautiful daughter, Sasha, on Saturday afternoon,” Alexander stated. ” Kevin and Lynn are loving and dedicated parents who will need our continued support throughout this very difficult time.&nbsp; Our entire organization is mourning the McHale family’s loss and we ask that you keep them in your thoughts and prayers.”</span></strong></p><p>This is an unbelievable tragedy that should serve as a wake-up call to every NBA player, coach, and fan to take a step back and consider what is actually important. Winning and losing shouldn’t matter as much in the aftermath of the McHale family’s tragic loss.</p><h2>Like Today’s play Kevin McHale Didn’t Made A Fortune With NBA</h2><p>The NBA did not pay players as much as it does now in the 1980s and 1990s. McHale earned only $3.5 million a year in his final two NBA seasons. Steph Curry is giggling somewhere, holding his $201 million contract.</p><p>McHale may not have amassed a fortune from his NBA contracts, but he has done rather well for himself in his second profession. McHale’s current net worth is $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. NBA broadcasting must be quite lucrative.</p><p>During his tenure with the Celtics, McHale was overshadowed by Larry Bird, Bill Walton, and Robert Parish, but he was just as crucial to the three titles as those superstars were. McHale had a fantastic playing career and is still doing well as an NBA analyst today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6y1sHnIrGSknaaeu265wqGYpZ1fZ352gJFo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cathleen-mcgrath-missing-person-police-still-searching.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cathleen Mcgrath Missing Person, Police Still Searching</a>
