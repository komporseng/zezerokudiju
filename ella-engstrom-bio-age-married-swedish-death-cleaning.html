Will our loved ones have to go through the hassle of sorting things out in our absence? This is exactly where Ella Engström comes in. She helps people sort through their junk, and luckily for us, her job’s featured in the TV show </span><i><span>The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this Ella Engström Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Ella Engström On The Gentle Art Of Swedish Death Cleaning</b></h3><p><span>Peacock’s brand new show, </span><i><span>The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning</span></i><span> premiered on April 27, 2023, and it followed eight different people as they received guidance from the “Death Cleaners” including Ella Engström on how to sort through their junk so their loved one would have as little hassle as possible in case of their death.</span></p><p><span>Obviously, the show about death cleaning sounds terrifying, but the show’s not exactly about “death.” Instead, Ella and her co-stars compassionately teach Midwesterners in Kansas City that crammed homes that resemble indoor swap meets make for an unhappy life.</span></p><p><i><span>The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning</span></i><span> was inspired by the best-selling 2018 book of its name by Margareta Magnusson — who also acted as an executive producer of the Peacock series. When she wrote the book, Margareta was just trying to introduce Americans to the quaint Nordic custom and the Swedish concept of “dostadning.” In simple words, it asked people to stop being sentimental as they get older. Take control of junk clogging at home. Don’t leave it as a burden for others to deal with when you’re gone. And don’t be afraid to talk about your death.</span></p><p><span>“American people tend to have a lot of everything, for example, seasonal-related stuff for every occasion like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other holidays,” Ella said. “This is very different from how we have it in Sweden. We have a more basic style used for most things. Then, we spice it up with small details instead. We use most of the things we have in our homes all the time.”</span></p><p><span>Joining Ella for the inaugural season of the Peacock show were her co-stars — <a href=#>Johan Svenson</a> (a Set Designer, Stylist, and Art Director), Blöm (a “happiness psychologist” and an author), and Amy Poehler (narrator).</span></p><h3><b>Ella Engström Career</b></h3><p><span>Ella Engström is an Interior designer and Organization coach. She’s been working in the profession for over 3 years, helping people to create homes that sustainably support the puzzle of life.</span></p><p><span>To be precise, it was in Jan 2020 that Ella started this adventure at </span><i><span>ENGSROOM</span></i><span> — a family business she founded.</span></p><p><span>Before that, she worked in Clas Ohlson in management for over a decade. Also, she has been an Instructor/inspirer at </span><i><span>Life N Joy </span></i><span>for almost 3 years, and a “Project Manager, Regional Visual Merchandiser, Sales Environment Manager, and Acting Store Manager” at</span><i><span> Åhléns AB</span></i><span> from 1999 to Mar 2012.</span></p><p><span>At </span><i><span>Åhléns</span></i><span>, Ella gained broad knowledge and experience in the retail trade. There,&nbsp; Ella was responsible for managing new listings as well as many other special projects within range development and concept development.</span></p><p><span>As for her education, Ella learned Trade and business at </span><i><span>Dalarna University</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Ella Engström Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>By 2023, Ella Engström garnered a net worth of under $500 thousand.</span></p><p><span>Rerptodlty, she made around $60 thousand per annum as an Interior designer in Sweden.</span></p><h3><b>Ella Engström Age</b></h3><p><span>Ella Engström was born before 1965. That made her at least 58 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span>The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She was the oldest cast that season.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Ella Engström Husband?</b></h3><p><span>Ella Engström married her husband Ola Engström on October 8, 1988 — after 4 years of dating. Now, fast forward to over 38 years later, the two are still keeping the fire burning with date nights, vacations, and a shared passion for design.</span></p><p><span>Just in April 2022, the two were enjoying fixing their home. Later, in September of that year, the lovebirds were spotted out on a date for a gala dinner at Aqua Marine Resort.</span></p><p><span>Her husband, Ola worked as a Transport manager at </span><i><span>Dala Freight</span></i><span>.
