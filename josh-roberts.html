Relationship</span></h2><p>Hannah Ferrier, a Below Deck Med alum, discussed her romance with Josh Roberts. As she revealed in the season 5 premiere, she met Josh while visiting her family in Australia. This is the point at which reality ceases to be singular. She added that the relationship is promising and she envisions a future in which she will marry and have children.</p><p>Josh and Hannah had been dating for a year at the time of the interview, having recently celebrated their first anniversary in October 2019. Additionally, Hannah stated in June 2020 that Josh preferred to keep their relationship private.</p><p>Hannah and Josh met in a Sydney bar following the conclusion of season 4. The couple flirted and immediately clicked. Hannah and Josh maintained a long-distance relationship while Hannah traveled the world on a yacht and Josh worked.</p><p>Hannah, on the other hand, is closing 2020 with a bang. To begin, on 26 October, she and her beau welcomed their daughter Ava Grace Roberts. Second, she and her boyfriend announced their engagement.</p><p>On 23 November 2020, the Below Deck Med star confirmed it. The couple had already been dating for two years at that point and will celebrate their second anniversary in October 2020.</p><p>Hannah posted a photo of her ring on Instagram with the caption,</p><p><strong>“After that, there were three…</strong></p><p><strong>as well as a ring ”</strong></p><p>And, as usual, Hannah withheld nothing from her fiance, Josh Roberts.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Josh_Roberts_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Josh Roberts start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>We have a rudimentary idea of what Josh Roberts does for a living solely based on his LinkedIn profile. He moved to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, after graduating from Oxford Brookes University. He’d secured a position as Senior Surveyor with Savills Vietnam Company Limited.</p><p>After nearly two years with the company, he joined Eastspring Investment Limited in Vietnam. He spent four years with the company as an Investment Manager. Josh later relocated to Singapore and began working for M&G Real Estate. He joined the company in July 2012 and worked as an asset manager until September 2017.</p><p>Josh arrived in Australia, however, to work for 151 Property. As with the previous two companies for which he worked, he assumed the same position within the company.

He is nowhere to be found on any of the world’s major social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p><p>This all indicated his preference for keeping his private life private rather than making it a topic of conversation for internet strangers.
