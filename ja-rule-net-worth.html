He purchased the house in 2001 for $1.875 million.</p><p>The beautiful home spans over 3 890 square feet.</p><p>The house features five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a wood theme, Brazilian Kos Floors, and stainless appliances. On the outside, the house has a garden, a driveway, and a garage.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Rappers are known for their cars, and Ja is no exception.</p><p>Here’s the list of the cars Ja Rule owns.</p><h4>Lamborghini Murcielago</h4><p>Ja owns a mint green Lamborghini Murcielago. The beast features a 6.5-liter V12 engine that generates 665 brake horsepower and 670-pound feet of torque.</p><p>The Bull can go from 0-100 km per hour in 3.4 seconds and reach the top speed of 330 km per hour.</p><p>The price of the car starts from $353,000.</p><h4>Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe</h4><p>The expense on Murcielago did not stop Ja from buying another extremely expensive car, Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe.</p><p>Ja paid over $400,000 for this coupe. The car comes equipped with a 6.75 liters V12 engine that pumps 563 brake horsepower and 720-pound feet of torque. The car comes with eight-speed automatic transmission.</p><h4>BMW i8</h4><p>This is another crown jewel Ja Rule has in his garage. The i8 was BMW’s first-ever plug-in hybrid car, which offers a combustion engine as well as an electric motor.</p><p>Though it is not the fastest car in his garage, it can go from 0-100 km per hour in 4.4 seconds and reach the top speed of 250 km per hour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ja-Rule-BMW-i8.jpg><p>Again the car might not be as fast as the mint bull, but it is more of an environmentally friendly car.</p><p>The car costs $147,000.</p><h4>Range Rover</h4><p>Just as importantly, least is the great classic celebrity car, the Range Rover. Ja Rule has been spotted several times in his Range Rover. He has also featured the vehicle in his music videos.</p><p>The Range Rover is an SUV that Land Rover first released in the 1970s. No car collection is ever complete if it does not have a Range Rove sitting on the corner of the garage.</p><p>Ja Rule’s car lineup might be a little smaller than expected, unlike other rappers.</p><p>But it is sophisticated. Nevertheless, the cars are still uber-luxurious and represent his celebrity status and loud persona.</p><h3>Watch</h3><p>The “Always on Time” rapper owns a Ralph Lauren watch. These watches are manufactured with the highest attention to detail and are considered a hidden treasure in the watch world.</p><p>The watch is water resident for 150 ft. Ja Rule splashed over $10,000 for this watch.</p><p>Just like the expensive watches, he also has a large collection of jewelry.</p><p>Reportedly, his jewelry collection is worth $100,000. He’s known for his diamond-encrusted bracelets, chains, and rings.</p><h2>Lifestyle</h2><p>Even though he blew most of his fortune on legal issues and tax evasions, he still maintains his celebrity status.</p><p>He has been a part of some business endeavors over the years and keeps himself busy.</p><p>His last album was released in 2016, “<strong>Coup the Grace</strong>.”</p><p>Throughout his career, he had feuds with some of the music industry giants, including <a href=# rel=noopener>50 Cent</a>, Eminem, and Dr. Dre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/50Cent-Ja-Rule.jpg><p>His most publicized feud was with “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>In Da Club</strong></a>” singer <a href=# rel=noopener>50 Cent</a>.</p><p>Apart from all those bad things, let’s talk about his passion.</p><p>Ja Rule is a huge sneakerhead. His sneaker collection includes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Nike Air Jordan Retro 3 Flip</strong></a>. He likes other brands, too, such as Adidas, Puma, and New Balance.</p><p>As far as his clothing is concerned, he goes for Burberry, Nike, and Ralph Lauren.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>As for charity Ja Rule created his own face masks and donated them to the homeless because he felt like the homeless were being forgotten.</p><p><strong>Apart from that, Ja supports L.I.F.E Foundation.</strong></p><p>Ja was once appointed as an official spokesperson of BET’s Campaign to Raise Awareness for HIV/AIDS.</p><h2>Movies, Endorsements, Investments, and Book Publication</h2><h3>Movies</h3><p>Ja Rule has appeared in numerous movies throughout his career.</p><p>He is mostly known for his part in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The Fast and The Furious</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Assault on Precinct 13</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Scary Movie</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Half Past Dead</strong></a>.</p><p>Similarly, he has worked on the soundtrack for several movies and television shows.</p><p>Regrettably, 2001 was a peak point in Ja Rule’s music career and he blew up his chance to appear in one of the most lucrative movie franchises.</p><p>Following his minor role in<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> <strong>The Fast and The Furious</strong></a>, which came with the paycheck of <strong>$15,000</strong>, he was offered another role in the sequel<strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 2 Fast 2 Furious</a>.</strong></p><p>But his big celebrity status and massive ego would not give him the liberty to work for a mere $500,000 for the movie. His role later went to Ludacris. He made over $18 million from the Fast franchise alone.</p><p>Moreover, as one of the stars, he would have locked the role and starred in all future Fast and Furious sequels with an ever-expanding paycheck.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>Apart from movies and music huge chunk of fortune came from brand endorsement for Ja Rule.</p><p>Over the years, he has endorsed brands such as Coca-Cola, Foot Locker, and Steve Madden.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>Evidently, Ja Rule and Billy McFarland, CEO of Fyre Media Inc., co-founded a fraudulently marketed luxury music festival.</p><p>It was created with the intent of promoting the Fyre app and booking musical talent.</p><p>The Fyre Festival was a luxurious musical retreat with supermodels, private jets, gourmet food, and yachts.</p><p>Ja, along with his partner, raised ticket money ranging from <strong>$4,000 to $250,000.</strong></p><p>But unfortunately, only a small amount of the raised money was actually utilized on the so-called luxurious musical retreat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ja-Rule-Fyre-Festival.jpg><p>The event was on a private island in the Bahamas, but none of the marketed amenities were provided to the attendees.</p><p>It was a disaster. The festival was more of a get-rich-quick scam.</p><p>Consequently, Ja and his partner were filed a $100 million lawsuits by the attendees.</p><p>He’s also founded his own clothing line called Ervingeoffrey. In addition, he is the co-owner of the beverage company The Mojito.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>Ja Rule published his memoir “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Unruly: The Highs and Lows of Becoming a Man</strong></a>” in July 2014.</p><p>The book Ja explains his enthralling story from his youth to the high rise of his career, international fame and lawsuits, and legal issues.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Ja Rule began his career in 1994 as a member of Cash Money Click that produced songs independently.</p><p>The group was signed to TVT records but dropped as they disbanded after just one year due to the arrest of one of the group members.</p><p>Ja Rule’s first solo appearance was “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Time to build</strong></a>.” The song was by Mic Geronimo and also featured DMX and Jay-Z.</p><p>In 1998 Ja signed with Def Jam records. He was even featured in<strong> Jay-Z’</strong>s song “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Can I Get A…</strong></a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DMX-JayZ-Ja-Rule.jpg><p>His debut album was released in 1999 named “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Venni Vetti Vecci</strong></a>,” which topped the Billboard 200.</p><p>In 2005 Ja’s contract with Def Jam expired.</p><p>He announced that he was coming up with his album “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Pain is Love</strong></a>” in 2011 but was released a year later. But after that, he went to jail for two years and was released in May 2013.</p><p>Following the prison release, Ja Rule and Glotti launched<strong> Murder Inc. Records</strong>.
