And this time, the flame’s huge. Allegations suggested that the TikTok star exposed herself to two minors and many are even demanding her arrest.</span></p><p><span>So, what has she done? And who is her ex-husband and parents? Find answers and more as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Kylie Strickland Allegations</b></h3><p><span>It was June 2022 when Kylie Strickland allegedly flashed herself to the two minors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to the reports, the TikTok star was in a pool with two young boys during a live recording when she asked the children if they wanted to see her breast and then proceeded to lift her swimsuit top.</span></p><p><span>The Pike County Sheriff’s Office reported the investigation into the incident had already begun.</span></p><p><span>In the meantime, multiple TikTok users took matters into their own hands, and posted videos that detail the allegations and called her a pervert. Likewise, a Reddit user enraged by this news wrote, “Trying to understand what public reaction she expected from this? Did she think people would think it was funny? Cute?? This is absolutely disgusting and in no way comical.”</span></p><p><span>While another stated, “If a male did this to young girls he’d already be arrested. Disgusting.”</span></p><p><span>It’s clear that the people were furious with Kylie, and demanded her arrest or worst. However, the legal ramifications of Kylie’s actions were still unclear.</span></p><p><span>But legal charges or not, the TikToker’s reputation on the platform has alretarnishedrasnished. The last we checked she had 263K followers (and decreasing) on her accunt@</span><a href=#><span>kylie.strickland3</span></a><span> which was changed to private.</span></p><p><span>The only explanation Kylie had about her actions then was that the kids weren’t hers and she had no responsibility for what they did.</span></p><p><span>But this wasn’t the first time Kylie was denigrated. Back in September 2021, the TikTok star also made the news when her mugshots went viral. She was reportedly arrested on September 10 that year.</span></p><h3><b>Kylie Strickland Ex-Husband</b></h3><p><span>Kylie Strickland’s ex-husband is named Travis R Strickland (age 32 as of 2022). Though we don’t know when the two exactly married, we do know that they were divorced before mid-2020.</span></p><p><span>But he isn’t the one Kylie talked about. The TikTok star infact suffered domestic abuse from her partner after Travis named Cody Weems.</span></p><p><span>As per the reports, Kylie was dating Cody for about two months when he started abusing her. But it wasn’t just physical abuse! From threats to killing her and her close ones including her dogs, Cody made Kylie feel helpless.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“All I could think about was ‘today is going to be the day.’ Today is going to be the day that he finally kills me and all I could think about was ‘I hope somebody is calling the police,’” Kylie recalled.</span></p><p><span>Also, the star remembered fighting him back and trying to hold on to the trees in many attempts to get away.</span></p><p><span>Kylie even alleged her ex-boyfriend of dragging her into the woods where he stomped on her causing a miscarriage. She survived with a fractured nose, a broken tailbone, and many bruises.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, Cody was booked into Upson County Jail and charged with assault on an unborn child, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, aggravated sexual battery, burglary, kidnapping, and battery. And the last we checked, he was still imprisoned.</span></p><p><span>But Kylie is still sacred, knowing that Cody could be released from jail on bond once it is posted.</span></p><p><span>Kylie’s even voiced her struggle with domestic violence over her TikTok. And because of her differing opinions, she was banned from the platform. Luckily, she had a backup account.</span></p><p><span>As for Kylie’s four kids, we do not know if she had all of them with her ex-husband, Travis.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Kylie Strickland Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Kylie Strickland flaunted a net worth of above $300 thousand in 2022. Yes, and it’s all from her online popularity. Reports had that at one point, she was even making around $1000 a day, thanks to TikTok.</span></p><p><span>Also, Kylie earned pretty well from Onlyfans @</span><a href=#><span>officialkyliestrickland</span></a><span> (where she charged $10/month for a subscription), and her merch that included autographed mugshot, and tees, all for $15.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#><span>Here</span></a><span>’s her LinkedIn.</span></p><h3><b>Kylie Strickland Teeth</b></h3><p><span>Kylie Strickland indeed has a beautiful smile. However, her pearly white teeth do make it seem a little unnatural. But so far, we’ve had no report that the TikTok star has had a teeth job. So, it’s possible that the brightness entirely comes from a product she’s been using.</span></p><p><span>Find the products she ever used on her Amazon store account @</span><a href=#><span>influencer-ce2bebe2</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>How Old Is Kylie Strickland?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Kylie Strickland was born on October 18, 1991.
